# CS2450-Project

  The UVsim is designed to work through operations using BasicML, and 100 slots of memory. It is currently designed to take in a text file with lines of 4 digit commands, the first two digits represent the operation that will be done, and the last two digits represent the area in memory that the operation will take place on. Currently the UVsim has 4 different mathmatical operations, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

Instructions for use:
Python is required to run code. In order to run this code we will need to open up the terminal. On windows you will navigate to the start menu, and from there you will search powershell. On mac you will navigate to the Finder app, open the applications folder, and then open the utilities folder, and then double click the terminal app. Once your terminal is open we will enter python3 main.py path/to/name_of_textfile.txt, following which the user will be asked for input. Given in this repository are a few test files that are available to try out.
