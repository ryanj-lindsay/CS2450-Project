# CS2450-Project

  The UVsim is designed to work through operations using BasicML, and 100 slots of memory. It is currently designed to take in a text file with lines of 4 digit commands, the first two digits represent the operation that will be done, and the last two digits represent the area in memory that the operation will take place on. Currently the UVsim has 4 different mathmatical operations, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

Instructions for use:
Python required to run code. Through the command line, we will run python3 main.py name_of_textfile.txt, following which the user will be asked for input. Given in this repository are a few test files that are available to try out.
